          <span class="blue-bg">I</span>f you’re looking to learn how to code, the sheer number of programming languages may be overwhelming – what language should you indeed learn?
        </p>
        <p><span class="blue-bg">F</span>ill out this <strong>quick questionaire <em>below</em></strong> to help you decide the best      programming language you might consider focusing on first.

        <h2><span class="blue-bg">O</span>verview</h2>
        <p><span class="blue-bg">T</span>hough each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing. </p>

        <div id="ruby">
          <h3><span class="blue-bg">R</span>uby</h3>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">R</span>uby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</p>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">D</span>eveloped to make developers have fun and be productive at the same time, Ruby was made popular by the Ruby on Rails framework, a full-stack web framework optimized for programming happiness. As Ruby reads like English and Rails has tools that make common development tasks easier “out-of-the-box”, many would recommend learning Ruby as your first programming language.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="php">
          <h3><span class="blue-bg">P</span>HP</h3>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">P</span>HP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.</p>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">P</span>HP is a server-side scripting language and is usually considered beginner-friendly because it’s easier to conceptualize what the PHP code will do, so it’s not difficult to pick up. Most websites have been built with PHP because the language is heavily specialized for the web.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="c-sharp">
          <h3><span class="blue-bg">C</span>#</h3>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">C</span># is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</p>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">C</span># is used for web development, game development, and general Microsoft development. Although Microsoft was not known for being cross-platform compatible in the past, Xamarin has been working on an open-source project called Mono, which aims to port C# to other platforms and bring better development tools to Linux developers. Recently you can also use C# to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android through Xamarin.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="java">
          <h3><span class="blue-bg">J</span>ava</h3>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">J</span>ava is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>
          <p><span class="blue-bg">N</span>ot to be confused with Java, JavaScript is a primarily client-side scripting language used for front-end development. JavaScript is compatible across all browsers and is used to create interactive web apps, often through libraries such as jQuery and front-end frameworks such as AngularJS, Ember.js, React, and more.</p>
